What is Cloud Foundry?
----------------------

Cloud Foundry is an open platform-as-a-service (PaaS). The system supports
multiple frameworks, multiple application infrastructure services and
deployment to multiple clouds.

Installation Notes
------------------

Cloud Foundry is made up of a number of system components (cloud controller,
health manager, dea, router, etc.). These components can run co-located in a
single vm/single os or can be spread across several machines/vm's.

For development purposes, the preferred environment is to run all of the core
components within a single vm and then interact with the system from outside of
the vm via an ssh tunnel. The pre-defined domain `*.vcap.me` maps to local host,
so when you use this setup, the end result is that your development environment
is available at [http://api.vcap.me](http://api.vcap.me).

For large scale or multi-vm deployments, the system is flexible enough to allow
you to place system components on multiple vm's, run multiple nodes of a given
type (e.g., 8 routers, 4 cloud controllers, etc.)

The detailed install instructions below walk you through the install process
for a single vm installation.

Versions of these instructions have been used for production deployments, and
for our own development purposes. many of us develop on mac laptops, so some
additional instructions for this environment have been included.

Detailed Install/Run Instructions:
----------------------------------

There are two methods for installing VCAP.  One is a manual process, which you
might choose to do if you want to understand the details of what goes into
a bringing up a VCAP instance. The other is an automated process contributed
by the community. In both cases, you need to start with a stock Ubuntu
server VM.

### step -1:

* setup a VM with a pristine Ubuntu 10.04.2 server 64bit image,
  [download here](http://www.ubuntu.com/business/get-ubuntu/download)
* you may wish to snapshot your VM now in case things go pear shaped.
* great snapshot spots are here and after step 4
* to enable remote access (more fun than using the console), install ssh.

To install ssh:

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server

### Automated Setup (experimental):

#### Step 0:
Run the install script. It'll ask for your sudo password at the
beginning and towards the end. The entire process takes ~1 hour, so just
keep a loose eye on it.

     sudo apt-get install curl
     bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/raw/master/setup/install)

NOTE: if you have issues with 'vmc target api.vcap.me' after using the
automated installer, exit out of the shell you did the install in, open
a new shell, and perform the following operations:

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap
    bin/vcap stop
    bin/vcap start

Jump to step 9 in the manual process to optionally setup an ssh tunnel
and test your installation.

### Manual Setup:

#### step 0: install system and rvm dependencies

    sudo apt-get install autoconf curl git-core ruby bison build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev

#### step 1: install rvm

For detailed [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) install instructions see: [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) or follow the quick steps below.

First install rvm using their script. Note: the `-k`
switch is only needed if the certificate validation fails:

    bash < <(curl -s -k -B https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)

Then follow the instructions given by the RVM
installer (a copy is included below for your convenience).

    # you must complete the install by loading RVM in new shells.
    #
    #
    #  1) Place the folowing line at the end of your shell's loading files
    #     (.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh),
    #     after all PATH/variable settings:
    #
    #     # This loads RVM into a shell session.
    #     [[ -s \"$rvm_path/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$rvm_path/scripts/rvm\"
    #
    #     You only need to add this line the first time you install rvm.
    #
    #  2) Ensure that there is no 'return' from inside the ~/.bashrc file,
    #     otherwise rvm may be prevented from working properly.
    #
    #     This means that if you see something like:
    #
    #    '[ -z \"\$PS1\" ] && return'
    #
    #  then you change this line to:
    #
    #  if [[ -n \"\$PS1\" ]] ; then
    #
    #    # ... original content that was below the '&& return' line ...
    #
    #  fi # <= be sure to close the if at the end of the .bashrc.
    #
    #    # this is a good place to source rvm
    #         [[ -s \"$rvm_path/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$rvm_path/scripts/rvm\"
    #
    #   <EOF> - this marks the end of the .bashrc
    #
    #     Be absolutely *sure* to REMOVE the '&& return'.
    #
    #     If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the
    #     bottom of your .bash_profile.
    #
    #     Placing all non-interactive (non login) items in the .bashrc,
    #     including the 'source' line above and any environment settings.
    #
    #  3) CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use rvm.


#### step 2: use rvm to install ruby 1.9.2 and make it default

    rvm install 1.9.2-p180
    rvm --default 1.9.2-p180

#### step 3: use rvm to install ruby 1.8.7

    rvm install 1.8.7

#### step 4: clone the vcap and vmc repos:

Optionally create new ssh keys and add them to your github account:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C me@example.com

Now create a directory for cloudfoundry and use git to clone the project into it:

    mkdir ~/cloudfoundry; cd ~/cloudfoundry
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap.git
    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap

The first time that you enter the vcap directory you may see an RVM warning
noting a new or modified .rvmrc file. Follow the instructions to review
the file and when asked to trust enter `yes` at the prompt.

There should be a `.rvmrc` file in the `~/cloudfoundry/vcap` directory.
Make sure that file is present and that it contains `rvm use 1.9.2`.

This release uses a handful of submodules. After cloning the vcap repo, you must run:

    git submodule update --init

This will check out additional resources which are required for the
project to run.

*NOTE:* Any time that you update the project with `git pull` you
must `git submodule update` afterwards or you will not have a complete
copy of the latest code.

Now install the vmc gem (command line tools for interacting with the platform):

    gem install vmc --no-rdoc --no-ri

#### step 5: run vcap_setup to prep cloudfoundry for launch

Points to keep in mind:

1). Answer Y to all questions

2). Remember your mysql password, you will need it in a minute

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap
    sudo setup/vcap_setup

This step may take a long time as your selections are downloaded and built as needed.

After `vcap_setup` completes, edit your `mysql_node.yml` config file:

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap/services/mysql/config
    vi mysql_node.yml # or use your editor of choice

Change the `pass` in the `mysql` section to the mysql root password
you created during install and save.

#### step 6: restart nginx with a custom config

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap
    sudo cp setup/simple.nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart

#### step 7: install bundler gem and run bundler:install

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap
    gem install bundler --no-rdoc --no-ri
    rake bundler:install

#### step 8: start the system

    cd ~/cloudfoundry/vcap
    bin/vcap start
    bin/vcap tail  # see aggregate logs

#### step 9: *Optional, mac users only*, create a local ssh tunnel

From your vm, run `ifconfig` and note eth0, let's say it's: 192.168.252.130
go to your mac terminal window and create a local port 80 tunnel.
Once you do this, from both your mac, and from within the vm, `api.vcap.me` and `*.vcap.me`
map to localhost which maps to your running cloudfoundry instance

    sudo ssh -L 80:192.168.252.130:80 mhl@192.168.252.130 -N

Trying your setup
-----------------

### step 10: validate that you can connect and tests pass
#### From the console of your vm, or from your mac (thanks to local tunnel)

    vmc target api.vcap.me
    vmc info

#### This should produce roughly the following:

    VMware's Cloud Application Platform
    For support visit support@cloudfoundry.com

    Target:   http://api.vcap.me (v0.999)
    Client:   v0.3.10

#### Play around as a user, start with:
    vmc register --email foo@bar.com --passwd password
    vmc login --email foo@bar.com --passwd password

#### To see what else you can do try:
    vmc help

Testing your setup
------------------

Once the system is installed, you can run the following command Basic System
Validation Tests (BVT) to ensure that major functionality is working.

    cd cloudfoundry/vcap
    cd tests && bundle package; bundle install && cd ..
    rake tests

### Unit tests can also be run using the following.

    cd cloud_controller
    rake spec
    cd ../dea
    rake spec
    cd ../router
    rake spec
    cd ../health_manager
    rake spec

### step 11: you are done, make sure you can run a simple hello world app.

Create an empty directory for your test app (lets call it env), and enter it.

    mkdir env && cd env

Cut and paste the following app into a ruby file (lets say env.rb):

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'sinatra'

    get '/' do
      host = ENV['VMC_APP_HOST']
      port = ENV['VMC_APP_PORT']
      "<h1>XXXXX Hello from the Cloud! via: #{host}:#{port}</h1>"
    end

    get '/env' do
      res = ''
      ENV.each do |k, v|
        res << "#{k}: #{v}<br/>"
      end
      res
    end

#### Create & push a 4 instance version of the test app, like so:
    vmc push env --instances 4 --mem 64M --url env.vcap.me -n

#### Test it in the browser:

[http://env.vcap.me](http://env.vcap.me)

Note that hitting refresh will show a different port in each refresh reflecting the different active instances

#### Check the status of your app by running:

    vmc apps

#### Which should yield the following output:

    +-------------+----+---------+-------------+----------+
    | Application | #  | Health  | URLS        | Services |
    +-------------+----+---------+-------------+----------+
    | env         | 1  | RUNNING | env.vcap.me |          |
    +-------------+----+---------+-------------+----------+
