1. run pool_tool in vcap/common/bin/pool_tool to create a user pool
called package cache with the appropriate number of users.

e.g. ./pool_tool -c package_cache,50

the number of users will limit the number of maximum concurrent requests
the package cache can process as each request needs a temporary user.

2. configure config/dev.yml to point to appropriate ruby runtimes.
