###Configuring runtimes.

1. configure config/package_cache.yml to point to appropriate the ruby runtimes to
build packages with.

###Supporting secure mode.

1. run pool_tool in vcap/common/bin/pool_tool to create a user pool
called package cache with the appropriate number of users.

e.g. ./pool_tool -c package_cache,50

the number of users will limit the number of maximum concurrent requests
the package cache can process as each request needs a temporary user.

2. ensure that the package cache (i.e. the vcap user) has sufficient
privilege to use sudo to chown files, and to run arbitrary commands
as a user in the user-pool-package_cache group.
