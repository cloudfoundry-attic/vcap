-add get interface to client, add tests that exercise this.

 some inbox cleaner to prevent resource leaks.

-check to see if something is already in the cache and don't add it for

-command line tool to exercise client library and make testing easy.
-start pushing to remote branch.

-add config file reader.

-refactor everything containing a purge! method, should have a file_store class
 that they inherit from, gem_builder could also potentially inherit from this?

-use native kill instead of run("pkill") as we can probably handle
errors more gracefully and be less black box.

--testing

-check unit tests are complete.
-have unit tests check file permissions
-rewrite all unit tests to use rspec.

-put in protection from massive gems being downloaded!
 e.g. run_as + quota's.

 have startup check in place to ensure everything lives under a
 sane root.
