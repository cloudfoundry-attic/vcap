#BUGS
----

-kind of nasty bug in inbox -- since file name is defined by content, user
could deny ability of another user to add a local gem by creating place holder
files that fill in the inbox. one way to solve this -- which is a gross hack
but will work, is by appending a secure nonce to the front of the file,
then renaming into an imports directory on the secure import and dropping
the nonce.

-another inbox consideration is ensuring that files do not linger in the inbox.
a per-user storage quota should at least provide an upper bound on space consumed,
a periodic cleaning of the inbox (say of files who have been there over some short
fixed interval (say 2 minutes) might also be a good measure.

#MUST HAVE
---------

-add functional test for error handling.


#SHOULD HAVE
#-----------


-add back pressure when we hit a limit on number of outstanding requests, stager
