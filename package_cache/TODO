#Worklist
---------


-deal with XXX's


#BUGS
----

-better build failure detection.

-fix unit tests to play nice with EM/fibers.

-handle gem not found error.

-potential errors from pkill?

#MUST HAVE
---------

-add some error handling, i.e. error type, error code, error message stuff.
 -couldn't find/download gem error.
 -couldn't build gem error.
 -gem in cache, not error, just return immediately.
 -error handling in server and client!


-add unix domain socket support to client.

#CLEANUP
-------
-stop using fixed offsets for user_pools, just install/remove users.

-on detecting a user is present, verify, if that fails, remove
 the user and re-install, don't just fail.


-add gitignore for test directories.

-change debug formatter to say method() instead of `in method`

-refactor everything containing a purge! method, should have a file_store class
 that they inherit from, gem_builder could also potentially inherit from this?
 (decide if there is enough commonality to justify this?)

-incorporate matt's logger.

-rename get_gem_path => get_path

-rework/eliminate gem_util.rb

-User pools/UserOps.
  -UserOps spec is ghetto, rewrite using nested example groups. (see chap 12 rspec
  book).

  -check to make sure unit tests complete.
  -do unit tests for process kill stuff.

#SHOULD HAVE
#-----------

-limit download gem sizes
-ulimits from dea for run_restricted.
-watch dog timer for run_restricted.

#OTHER FEATURES
--------------

-allow inbox copy to be replaced with a rename e.g. import_method = :rename

-think about fs_cleaner_daemon for inbox, among other things, or just add
 some inbox cleaner to prevent resource leaks - prolly cleaner thread
 type thing.

-command line tool to exercise client library and make testing easy.

-put in protection from massive gems being downloaded!
 e.g. run_as + quota's.

-better sandboxing.

-create gem_builder that managers user pool itself.

-add support for npm's, pip's or java stuff and modularize to support this.


#TESTING
--------
-write stress tester.
-check unit tests are complete.
-have unit tests check file permissions
