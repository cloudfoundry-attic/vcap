Description:
This subdirectory contains the chef cookbooks to deploy and setup Cloud Foundry
in a single or multiple host environment. The cookbooks assume that they are
running on a freshly installed Ubuntu 10.04 server.

Quick Start:
-----------
   To Deploy:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup

         It will download Cloud Foundry source code into
            $HOME/cloudfoundry/vcap

         It will create a default deployment named 'devbox' under
            $HOME/cloudfoundry/.deployments/devbox

   To Start:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev start

   To Stop:
      vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev stop


More Options:
------------

o To use Cloud Foundry source code that you have already downloaded.
   To Deploy:
     e.g. If Cloud Foundry source is downloaded into $HOME/projects/vcap.

      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -d $HOME/projects

        It will not download Cloud Foundry source code. It will just setup the config files to
        use the Cloud Foundry source code from $HOME/projects/vcap.

        It will create a default deployment named 'devbox' under
          $HOME/projects/.deployment/devbox

   To Start:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects start

   To Stop::
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects stop

o To use a custom deployment config
  e.g. If you want to use the multihost sample config file
  $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/sample/multihost_mysql/dea.yml

   To Deploy:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev_setup -d $HOME/projects -c $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/deployments/sample/multihost_mysql/dea.yml

        It will not download Cloud Foundry source code. It will just setup the config files to
        use the Cloud Foundry source code from $HOME/projects/vcap.

        It will create a deployment named 'dea' under
          $HOME/projects/.deployment/dea

   To Start:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects -n dea start

   To Stop:
      $HOME/projects/vcap/dev_setup/bin/vcap_dev -d $HOME/projects -n dea stop
