# JOBS
# ----
#
# Jobs represents the various installable components of cloud foundry
# They are divided into 2 groups
#  - install (Jobs that should be installed on this server/host)
#  - installed (Jobs that have been installed on other server/hosts whose properties are required by the #               jobs that are scheduled to be installed on this server/host)
#
#  e.g.
#   Lets say "nats" is installed on server_A. Next, you would like to install
#  the "router" on server_B. In this case, the deployment config file for
#  server_B will look like the following.
#
# jobs:
#   install:
#     - router
#   installed:
#     - nats:
#         uri: "nats://<user>:<passwd>@<server A>"
#
#
# List of all supported jobs
#   - all (deploys all cloudfoundry components)
#   - nats
#   - router
#   - cloud_controller
#   - health_manager
#   - dea
#   - ccdb
#   - mysql
#   - redis
#   - mongodb
#   - postgresql
#
# List of properties that should be specified for installed jobs.
