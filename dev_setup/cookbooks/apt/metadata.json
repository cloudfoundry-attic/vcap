  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nConfigures various APT components on Debian-like systems.  Also includes a LWRP.\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\nThe default recipe runs apt-get update during the Compile Phase of the Chef run to ensure that the system's package cache is updated with the latest. It is recommended that this recipe appear first in a node's run list (directly or through a role) to ensure that when installing packages, Chef will be able to download the latest version available on the remote APT repository.\n\nThis recipe also sets up a local cache directory for preseeding packages.\n\ncacher\n------\nInstalls the apt-cacher package and service so the system can provide APT caching. You can check the usage report at http://{hostname}:3142/report. The cacher recipe includes the `cacher-client` recipe, so it helps seed itself.\n\ncacher-client\n-------------\nConfigures the node to use the apt-cacher server as a client.\n\nResources/Providers\n===================\n\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional APT repositories.\n\n# Actions\n\n- :add: creates a repository file and builds the repository listing\n- :remove: removes the repository file\n\n# Attribute Parameters\n\n- repo_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover\n- uri: the base of the Debian distribution\n- distribution: this is usually your release's codename...ie something like `karmic`, `lucid` or `maverick`\n- components: package groupings..when it doubt use `main`\n- deb_src: whether or not to add the repository as a source repo as well\n- key_server: the GPG keyserver where the key for the repo should be retrieved\n- key: if a `key_server` is provided, this is assumed to be the fingerprint, otherwise it is the URI to the GPG key for the repo\n\n# Example\n\n    # add the Zenoss repo\n    apt_repository \"zenoss\" do\n      uri \"http://dev.zenoss.org/deb\"\n      components [\"main\",\"stable\"]\n      action :add\n    end\n    \n    # add the Nginx PPA; grab key from keyserver\n    apt_repository \"nginx-php\" do\n      uri \"http://ppa.launchpad.net/nginx/php5/ubuntu\"\n      distribution node['lsb']['codename']\n      components [\"main\"]\n      keyserver \"keyserver.ubuntu.com\"\n      key \"C300EE8C\"\n      action :add\n    end\n    \n    # add the Cloudkick Repo\n    apt_repository \"cloudkick\" do\n      uri \"http://packages.cloudkick.com/ubuntu\"\n      distribution node['lsb']['codename']\n      components [\"main\"]\n      key \"http://packages.cloudkick.com/cloudkick.packages.key\"\n      action :add\n    end\n    \n    # remove Zenoss repo\n    apt_repository \"zenoss\" do\n      action :remove\n    end\n    \nUsage\n=====\n\nPut `recipe[apt]` first in the run list. If you have other recipes that you want to use to configure how apt behaves, like new sources, notify the execute resource to run, e.g.:\n\n    template \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d/my_apt_sources.list\" do\n      notifies :run, resources(:execute => \"apt-get update\"), :immediately\n    end\n\nThe above will run during execution phase since it is a normal template resource, and should appear before other package resources that need the sources in the template.\n\nPut `recipe[apt::cacher]` in the run_list for a server to provide APT caching and add `recipe[apt::cacher-client]` on the rest of the Debian-based nodes to take advantage of the caching server.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\nAuthor:: Matt Ray (<matt@opscode.com>)\nAuthor:: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright 2009-2011 Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n",
