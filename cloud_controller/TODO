#MUST DO.

-support for fd,memory,disk,io quota's.
-make sure Resque gets setup todo authentication!!!



#Someday
-delete verb allows any user to delete any other
if remote-registration is allowed, which seems overly permissive.

-a terabyres of compressed zero bits (or similar super-compressed objects) could
be used to blow out the file system. (in resource pool and staging)

-create cache reaper (clean out old stuff?), see space concerns above.
