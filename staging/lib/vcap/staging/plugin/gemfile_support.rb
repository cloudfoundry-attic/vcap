  # OK, so this is our workhorse.
  # 1. If file has no Gemfile.lock we never attempt to outsmart it, just stage it as is.
  # 2. If app has been a subject to 'bundle install --local --deployment' we ignore it as
  #    user seems to be confident it just work in the environment he pushes into.
  # 3. If app has been 'bundle package'd we attempt to compile and cache its gems so we can
  #    bypass compilation on the next staging (going to step 4 for missing gems).
  # 4. If app just has Gemfile.lock, we fetch gems from Rubygems and cache them locally, then
  #    compile them and cache compilation results (using the same cache as in step 3).
  # 5. Finally we just copy all these files back to a well-known location the app honoring
  #    Rubygems path structure.
  # NB: ideally this should be refactored into a set of saner helper classes, as it's really
  # hard to follow who calls what and where.
